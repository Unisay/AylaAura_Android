AylaSDK
=======
Accelerate Ayla Platform Development


Build using Android Studio 2.3 or higher
==============================
Clone the repository into your working directory. By default it checks out the master branch.

    # git clone https://github.com/AylaNetworks/Android_AylaSDK_Public

Upgrade your Android Studio to version 2.3 or higher.
Open Android Studio and select "Open existing Android Studio project"
Navigate to the Android_AylaSDK folder and select it to be opened

From the Android Studio "Build" menu, select "Make Project"

If the build succeeds, the generated .aar file can be found in the
library/build/outputs directory.

There are 2 kinds of tests on the source tree:
1: Instrumentation based connected android tests: library/src/androidTest. These tests run on a connected Android device or emulator. So it is slow but it covers real code path well.
2: Robolectric tests: library/src/test. These tests run on your local JVM with no need of Android emulator or device. So it is much faster than conected Android tests. However "patch_source.rb" script needs to be run before running these tests due to Robolectric's limitation.

In Android Studio, these tests may be run by right-clicking on the "androidTest" folder or "test" in the project
window and selecting "Run Tests...", or individual test files within that folder
may be run the same way. As mentioned above, before running individual Robolectric tests inside Android Studio, it is required to run this command once: "cd test_scripts; ./patch_source.rb". After you run or debug Robolectric tests, run "cd test_scripts; ./unpatch_source.rb" to undo the SDK source code changes due to Robolectric tests.

From command line, command "./gradlew connectedAndroidTest" can be used to run connected Android tests. To run Robolectric tests, "cd test_scripts" first and then run "./run_robolectric_tests.sh" command.
Note: inside the script, it runs "gradlew testDebugUnitTest". If you change it to"gradlew test", it will run the same Robolectric tests twice: once for debug build and once for release build.

If you are going to be running these tests, first, you will need to update the TestConstants.java
to use your own credentials and DSNs for the tests. Many tests will fail without updating the TestConstants.java. Secondly, you need at least one Ayla certificated device like Ayla Evaluatoin Board to make meaningful tests; Thirdly, you need to modify the test code to match your specific device and settings details. All these can be done when you are familar with the test code.

API Documentation
===================================================
JavaDoc is available and is preferable to the reference guide for specifics on individual method calls. To build the JavaDoc documentation:

$cd <lib_dir>
$./gradlew generateReleaseJavadoc

if you see message asking you to upgrade to Gradle 3.3, you can use Gradle 3.3 installed by Android Studio 2.3. In Android Studio 2.3, click on "Preferences" then "Build, Execution, Deployment" then "Build Tools" then "Gradle" to find its full path. Now you can set your environment variable PATH to use this Gradle 3.3.

There may be warning and errors building the documentation, but it will build successfully. The javaDoc will be available at .../Android_AylaSDK_Public/library/build/docs/javadoc/index.html.
use the following command on Mac to view documentation in a browser:
$open library/build/docs/javadoc/index.html

Generate Stand-alone .jar or .aar File
=================
To create a .jar and/or .aar file to include in a projec:
$ ./gradlew jar
$ ./gradlew aar

It will generate Android_AylaSDK.jar or Android_AylaSDK.aar file in the library/build/outputs folder.

Contribute your code
====================

If you would like to contribute your own code change to our project, please submit pull requests against the "incoming" branch on Github. We will review and approve your pull requests if appropriate.

Special Notes In version 5.3 of the Ayla Mobile SDK:

changes were made related to SSO sign-in that will require additions to classes that implement AylaAuthProvider.

Because SSO providers manage user profiles as well as authenticating users, the AylaAuthProvider interface has been augmented with interfaces to update or delete the SSO user. The Ayla SDK will call these methods on the AylaAuthProvider that was used to sign in when requested to update or delete the session's user account.

The Ayla implementations of AylaAuthProvider (e.g. UsernameAuthProvider, CachedAuthProvider) have been updated to implement these methods to change the profile information on the Ayla user service. External identity providers will need to implement these methods to update or delete the account information on the identity provider's service. The following methods will need to be implemented in the mobile application on any class that implements the AylaAuthProvider interface:

// Updates the user profile information with the contents of the AylaUser parameter AylaAPIRequest updateUserProfile(AylaUser user, Listener successListener,ErrorListener errorListener);

// Deletes the current user account AylaAPIRequest deleteUser(AylaSessionManagersessionManager, Listener successListener, ErrorListener errorListener);
